Docker image = Bare mim os + App run time + system packages and dependencies+App code and is portable in nature
Bare min os = no unnecassary packages
Docker image is static file
Docker container is running instance of Docker image
Install docker it will create a group docker, users who are in this group or root user can only run docker commands
usermod -aG docker <username> -> to add user to docker group
docker images - list docker images
docker pull nginx -> First it will check for local repo if not it will pull from docker hub
username, image name and version
joindevops/catalogue:1.0.0
seenu/catalogue:1.0.0
for official image it would be nginx:latest or nginx:1.0.0
docker create <image>:tag -> to create a container
docker ps -a
docker start <CID>
docker stop <CID>
docker rm <CID>
docker images
docker rmi <image id>
how can you access docker container from internet?
It can be accessed by Enabling the port, we need to open host port that can redirect traffic to container
docker run -d -p <host-port>:<container-port>
host port can be any port but container port should be default
how to get terminal access to running container
docker -exec -it <container-id> bash
docker inspect cid/image-id
docker logs <CID>
Dockerfile -> It is declarative way of creating custom images
Dockerfile will keep all instructions in a file called as dockerfile and build the container
Teraform is declarative, what you write you get it
docker build -t url/username/image-name:tag .
